## Implementation approach
We will use Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, for the backend of the website. Flask-SQLAlchemy will be used for database operations, and Flask-WTForms for form handling. For the frontend, we will use Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. We will also use Chart.js for displaying cashflow and workflow data in a visually appealing way.

## Python package name
```python
"business_flow_tracker"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "routes.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "templates/layout.html",
    "templates/login.html",
    "templates/register.html",
    "templates/dashboard.html",
    "static/css/main.css",
    "static/js/main.js"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +int id
        +str username
        +str password_hash
        +__init__(username: str, password: str)
        +check_password(password: str) : bool
    }
    class CashFlow {
        +int id
        +float amount
        +datetime date
        +User user
        +__init__(amount: float, date: datetime, user: User)
    }
    class Workflow {
        +int id
        +str description
        +datetime date
        +User user
        +__init__(description: str, date: datetime, user: User)
    }
    class Allocation {
        +int id
        +float amount
        +User user
        +__init__(amount: float, user: User)
    }
    class Payment {
        +int id
        +float amount
        +User user
        +__init__(amount: float, user: User)
    }
    User "1" -- "*" CashFlow
    User "1" -- "*" Workflow
    User "1" -- "*" Allocation
    User "1" -- "*" Payment
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant U as User
    participant C as CashFlow
    participant W as Workflow
    participant A as Allocation
    participant P as Payment
    M->>U: create user
    U->>M: return user
    M->>C: create cashflow
    C->>M: return cashflow
    M->>W: create workflow
    W->>M: return workflow
    M->>A: create allocation
    A->>M: return allocation
    M->>P: create payment
    P->>M: return payment
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
