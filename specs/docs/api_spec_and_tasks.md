## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application. It initializes Flask, SQLAlchemy, and other necessary libraries."),
    ("models.py", "Defines the User, CashFlow, Workflow, Allocation, and Payment classes. It also contains the database schema."),
    ("forms.py", "Defines the forms used in the application, such as the registration and login forms."),
    ("routes.py", "Defines the routes for the application. It handles requests and responses."),
    ("templates/*.html", "Contains the HTML templates for the application. It defines the structure and layout of the web pages."),
    ("static/css/main.css", "Contains the CSS styles for the application. It defines the look and feel of the web pages."),
    ("static/js/main.js", "Contains the JavaScript code for the application. It handles client-side logic and interactions.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "forms.py",
    "routes.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "templates/layout.html",

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
We need to clarify how the cashflow and workflow data will be visualized using Chart.js. Also, we need to decide on the database to be used with Flask-SQLAlchemy.
